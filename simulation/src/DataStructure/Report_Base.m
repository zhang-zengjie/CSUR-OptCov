%% Description
%   - This is an abstract class to assign the Timestamp and PublisherID whenever a report is created.
%   - Each report created by one agent is assigned with a specific sender's ID and published to the environment. 
%   - A peer-to-peer report inherits this class and has additional information that is the receiver's ID. (See Child Class ...) 

%% Attention
%   - All report structure is encapsulated to avoid race condition and to simplify the asynchronous simulation in the future.
%   - All child classes must define the printing function so that the sender or receiver can print out the internal private information 
%     to simplify the debugging process.
